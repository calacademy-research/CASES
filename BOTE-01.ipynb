    "## Flattening the curve\n",
    "The oft mentioned curve is the \"infected\" curve from the family of SIR models (Susceptible, Infected, Removed). In the simulation below, the I curve is in red. In this case it shows the fraction of the population infected at any given time. The objective is to keep that peak below hospital capacity to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. There are many strategies available for doing that, but they depend on the disease. With COVID-19, we lack a vaccine, there are no cures, and the duration of the disease can be quite long. If we assume that recovery confers immunity, then the options available come down to managing the rates of infection, and treatments that shorten hospitalization time. \n",

    "In the simulation below, population is normalized to a maximum of 1.0, the overall infection rate is b ($\\beta$), and the rate at which infected persons are removed from the population ($\\gamma$) rate is g. $\\beta$ is a combination of several factors: the average number of contacts per person per time, multiplied by the probability of disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject. SIP orders focus on reducing the average number of contacts, while hygiene mechanisms (masks, washing hands, etc.) focus on the probability of transmission. The following estimates or values are used:\n",
    "1. $N$ is the total population of Los Angeles County - 10,098,052.\n",
    "2. The number of hospital beds, $H(0)\\approx 23,579$.\n",
    "3. The fraction of the susceptible population on March 2nd, $S(0)= 0.999998$.\n",
    "3. Fraction of population infected, $I$, $\\therefore = 0.000002$.\n",
    "4. The duration of the disease is taken to be 14 days, $\\therefore \\gamma=1/14=0.07$.\n",
    "5. $R_0$: The basic reproduction number is defined as the number of cases that are expected to occur on average in a homogeneous population as a result of infection by a single individual, when the population is susceptible at the start of an epidemic, before widespread immunity starts to develop and before any attempt has been made at immunization. The value used here is at the high end of early estimates made in east Asia, namely from Wuhan and South Korea. Those are the rates that we are very afraid of. Here I use 4.5.\n",

One way to manage this is to reduce $\\beta$ dramatically, most practically by reducing $R$. That is the logic behind \"flattening the curve\".

    "Our next question is, what would the \"cost\" be to the economy in order to buy this time? Continuing our crude estimates, we wish to reduce the number of daily intimate contacts per person by half. Now, we simply cannot remove 50% of the workforce, because reducing $R$ means isolating or quarantining households. Statista estimated a total of 1,382,293 households in LA in 2018. The average household size is therefore 7.3 persons (yikes). Thus if we isolated or quarantined even half of the households, that represents 691,647 workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we distributed that labour reduction uniformly among the industrial sectors, what would the impact be? The total labour force for LA in February was 4,573,600. The reduction is therefore 15%."
